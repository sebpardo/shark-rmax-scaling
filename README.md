Data and analysis for "Body mass, temperature, and depth shape productivity in sharks and rays"
===========
  
This repository contains the data and model-fitting process used for the article
"Body mass, temperature, and depth shape productivity in sharks and rays", which
is currently in press at *Ecology and Evolution*.

Files needed for reproducing the analyses are:

`/`
- `rmax-scaling-analysis.R`: R code to load data, fit models, do information-theoretic comparisons, and check diagnostics.

`data/`
- `chond-data.csv`: Life history data for 63 chondrichthyan species compiled for the study. Traits include maximum weight, median water temperature, median depth, and maximum intrinsic rate of population increase 
(*r<sub>max</sub>*).
- `stein-et-al-single.tree`: Phylogenetic tree from Stein et al. (2018) used in analyses.
